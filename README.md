# GraphQL

**WIP**

GraphQL implementation of Facebook's Declarative API Model over typical Imperative RESTful APIs. The goal is to implement Relay based on Rust using tokio-http2 and other async multiplexing code libraries.

It's unclear if this will be a full app or library at this point (point of creation of project).
